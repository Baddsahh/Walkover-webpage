        <p class="font1">The digital age refers to present time use of machines and computers to present information.
            The digital age had an overall impact on our societies and day to day activities. It has a lot of advantages
            and disadvantages i.e. it came with so many opportunities as well as costs.

            We are living in the age in which professionals in digital technologies are trying to push their boundaries
            on becoming more advanced in technology even beyond our imagination. Digital world has given a new
            explanation to technology which is now used as a mode of expression, interactions, entertainments, learning
            etc.</p>
        <p class="font1">Most of us knew that there will be a stage in life where digital devices will be the most
            important part of human beings. Let’s take ourselves as an example here; we use smart phones, ipads, laptops
            etc. Devices that we carry with us whenever we go to the toilet, but the most important question here is…can
            we survive without these devices in our possession or pockets? The answer will most definitely be “no” for
            most of us depend so much on these devices in our daily life or activities.</p>
        <p class="font1">As we know that we are living in the digital world and these devices have changed completely
            the way human beings have lived before, due to the simplicity of using digital devices from texting,
            sending/receiving pictures/music/, making video calls and other hundreds of functions that digital devices
            have. These devices have even made us to be able to perform multiple tasks as soon as we hold them in our
            hands, we might read a message, listen to music, talking to someone, checking Facebook accounts etc. But how
            do we divide our attention from these tasks? We as humans may not perform multitasking accurately like how
            computers do, as we lack the ability to monitor multiple tasks at the same time but yet we can give
            individual attention to each task.

            The essential thing to humans on these digital devices is their memory, which has extended extremely fast
            and efficiently. We use this memory part of the digital devices from storing very critical secrets,
            important business documents, pictures etc. Not only due to its faithfulness but also the ability to
            maintaining the stored information for a very long time as long as we keep them in our machines and nobody
            can access them without our permission. Professionals in memory engineering have managed to make our lives
            easier by creating and improving the digital memory that we use. Instead of saving information in our
            heads/papers we just save them in our digital devices and carry the saved information with us wherever we go
            to and we do not even worry about them once they are stored.</p>
        <p class="font1">Digital age has impacted the social life of societies hugely. In the past, most of our social
            interactions were private and undocumented. That is increasingly not the case with the advent of digital
            age. When we interact with each other through the internet, we leave digital records behind. Companies like
            Facebook and Twitter have huge databases full of all kinds of information about our social behaviours. Let’s
            think of the days where there were no online messengers, no emails, and no cell phones. Indeed cellular
            technology made it possible for us to communicate over wireless media. Web communication facilities have
            worked wonders in speeding long-distance communication. Today we can reach and keep in touch with our family
            and friends…even our enemies, with the help of social networks like bbm, facebook, twitter, skype etc.On the
            other hand, they have deprived mankind of the warmth of personal contact. Emails replaced handwritten
            letters and communication lost its personal touch. With the means of communication so easily accessible,
            that magic in waiting to reach someone and the excitement that followed has vanished. Also, the internet has
            bred many unethical practises, like hacking, spamming etc. Internet crime is on the rise. The internet being
            an open platform lacks regulation. There is no regulation on the content displayed on websites. Internet
            gambling has become an addiction for so many, access to pornographic sights and inappropriate information is
            made accessible to children. Overexposure to the internet has taken its toll. Children are spending all
            their time playing online and less or almost no time on the ground. Youngsters are spending most of their
            time social networking, missing on the joys of real social life.
