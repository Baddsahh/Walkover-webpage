        <p class="font1">Medical training cannot be equated with merely studying for a degree. It encompasses much more,
            challenging one's values, self perception and perspective on life itself. During five years at medical
            school, the individual irreversibly alters to become “a medic”, not just “a student of medicine”, no matter
            how much detachment from the course and its associated lifestyle the individual has endeavoured to preserve.
            In the following article, we intend to explore the different stages of training and discuss how each shapes
            the student. “Becoming a medic” intellectually, emotionally and spiritually is the inevitable consequence of
            spending five years at medical school, and the assumption of this role is indeed crucial to survival in
            medical practice. The importance of bringing our own individual qualities to the profession must, however,
            not be overlooked. Personal flair and abilities should be nurtured, not suppressed during medical school. A
            diversity of interests serves both to ease the pressures laid upon us at medical school, and to broaden our
            characters and deepen our understanding of humanity. Medical students, while necessarily adapting to the
            role of a doctor, should emerge from their training not as narrow “medics” but as enthusiastic,
            compassionate people equipped to treat patients to the best of their ability.</p>
        <p class="font1">First year medical students are very diverse. People choose to study medicine for reasons as
            diverse as the individuals themselves. Their parents may be doctors, in which case the child is brought up
            surrounded by medical jargon; for them, medicine is “the norm”. Financial and job security, social prestige,
            altruism, pure interest, seeking a challenge . . . different motivators bring together the hundred or so
            expectant students sitting in the first year medical school lecture theatre on the first day of freshers'
            week. Looking around on that day, you know that amongst these strange individuals will be lifelong friends,
            a support network, and some rivals. We remember being completely in awe of our peers as they recited the
            impressive achievements in academia, in the arts, in sport, which clinched their places here. An air of
            confidence and arrogance, laced with fear, emanated from the group. A collage of different people with
            different expectations, values and backgrounds start the five-year process of changing to become doctors.
        </p>
        <p class="font1">Despite the initial diversity, many candidates are similar in that they experienced a subtle
            yet significant change in attitude towards them resulting from their decision to apply for medicine. Coping
            should be innate in a medical school applicant. No longer can you wince when cutting open a pig's eye in A
            level biology, nor display even a trace of squeamishness if faced with flesh and blood after a sports field
            injury. On the contrary, one is subject to an implied obligation to run to the victim's aid and know (or at
            least confidently feign knowledge of) exactly how to handle any incident. Applying for medicine casts you as
            one of the more responsible, diligent and intelligent in your year, which itself brings an implicit pressure
            to live up to that image. Any underachievement, or mere failure to excel, is glaringly spotlighted by the
            incandescent knowledge that the course for which you are applying has such dauntingly competitive entry
            criteria. Thus, right from the moment a student suggests he or she go for a place at medical school, the
            realisation that medicine is not just another degree filters in. Already your own and other people's
            perceptions of you are altering.</p>
        <p class="font1">Few people really know what is expected of them, or how they should adapt to their new role as
            “medical students” as they enter medical school, but many have an idea. A factual anecdote serves to
            highlight this point. Following coffee break on the first day of freshers' week, a “house officer” stormed
            into the lecture theatre, doors flapping wildly in his wake. He barked that he was the “welfare and
            discipline representative”, and we'd better jolly well listen to what he had to say: “Now you are medics!
            You are different from other students at this university. One day you will be doctors and you are expected
            to behave accordingly. As from now you will dress smartly and conservatively. You will always be punctual.
            You are expected to work harder than you have ever worked before. Remember at all times that you are setting
            an example . . . . Think hard about this before you smoke, drink or indulge in any forms of risky
            behaviour!” It is noteworthy that a good many of us were completely taken in by this spoof. Demands such as
            those above could, just could, have been real.
